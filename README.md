#### The main goal of this project is to learn and experiment as much as I can with the art of algorithmic trading. The goal right now is not to find my own edge, but to truly understand the parameters to creating one through coding preexisting strategies
#### A big chunk of the project deals with automating techincal analysis for buy/sell signals-- and backtesting these results to see how the algorithm performed.

##### There are many people who live and die by chart patterns technical analysis. There are also those who swear that its the astrology of trading and although these patterns are present; it is merely confirmation bias which proves these to be true.

##### Moreso than using these techniques and strategies as a whole truth, I am more interested in observing how often these patterns and why exactly they seem to occur. (Of course, I'm also interested in each strategy's PnL)

## Files:
- __intro.ipynb__ - This is the first notebook in the project. Used as an introduction to indicators, charting, signals using just pandas and plotly. I also try to explains basic indicators and how signals work. A way to scratch the surface of technical analysis. Also explains basic indicators like EMA and MACD. In each following individual usage of new indicators I will explain them
