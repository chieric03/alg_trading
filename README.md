# Algorithmic Trading


#### The main goal of this project is to learn and experiment as much as I can with the art of algorithmic trading.  
#### A big chunk of the project deals with automating techincal analysis for buy/sell signals-- and backtesting these results to see how the algorithm performed.

##### I wanna preface this by saying this is not financial advice. If trading could be so simply automated, software engineers would probably just be billionaires and there'd be an overwhelming amount of open internships and jobs that it'd be a win-win for me. However, this is not the case.  Technical Analysis has for sure made many people a lot of money and has been proven to give an edge in the market, but it is also known that it can be considered as the astrology of trading.`
